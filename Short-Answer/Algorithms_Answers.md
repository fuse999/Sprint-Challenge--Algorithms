#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This Code runs O(n) time, checks if a is less than n3, and increments by n2 each time.


b) This Code runs O(n^2) time, The code checks that j is less than n, and we run j**2 each time.


c) This Code runs O(n) time, the code iterates through the number of bunnies

## Exercise II

What i would do is, start at the middle of the building, drop the egg, if the egg != break,
you can eliminate = buildings below, if egg breaks, you can eliminate = buidlings above. 
Continue to do this until f is found

O(logn)
